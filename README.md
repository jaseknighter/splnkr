### page 3: envelopes
<img src="images/pages/page2/page2_envelopes.png" width="66%">
<!-- ![](images/pages/page2/page2_envelopes.png) -->

the two shapes displayed on page 3 represent envelopes which may be applied to external devices (i.e. crow, jf, midi, w/). the first envelope is also be used to shape the granular envelope if enabled (see *effects* below for details). 

an extension of Mark Eats' [envgraph class](https://github.com/monome/norns/blob/main/lua/lib/envgraph.lua), the two envelopes may be set with a variable number of control points or *nodes*.

there are 5 types of controls for each of the two envelopes: 

*env level*: the maximum amplitude of the envelope  
*env length*: the length of the envelope  
*node time*: when the node is processed by the envelope  
*node level*: the amplitude of the envelope at the node time  
*node angle*: the shape of the ramp from the prior node time to the current node time

with a few exceptions, the last of the three control types (node time, node level, and node angle) are adjustable for each of envelopes nodes.

fine grain controls: all of the envelope controls allow for fine grain control using k1+e3.

#### envelope modulation
<img src="images/pages/page2/page2_envelope_mods.png" width="66%">
<!-- ![](images/pages/page2/page2_envelope_mods.png) -->

pressing k1+k2 on the env screen brings up the *env modulation* menu. once enabled, the menu can be navigated using e2 and e3. each envelope has eight modulation parameters:  
  
* *mod prob*: The probability that one of the other modulation parameters will be evaluated. If it is set to 0%, no envelope modulation will occur for the selected envelope.  
* *time prob*: The probability that the time value for each of the envelope's nodes will be modulated.  
* *time mod amt*: The amount of modulation that will be applied to the time value of each of the envelope's nodes.  
* *level prob*: The probability that the level value for each of the envelope's nodes will be modulated.  
* *level mod amt*: The amount of modulation that will be applied to the level value of each of the envelope's nodes.  
* *curve prob*: The probability that the curve value for each of the envelope's nodes will be modulated.  
* *curve mod amt*: The amount of modulation that will be applied to the curve value of each of the envelope's nodes.  
* *env mod nav*: Selects which of the above seven parameters are selected on when env modulation is visible (by pressing k1+k3) on the env screen. This parameter is useful for controlling the env ui via midi. 

<!-- In addition, the *show env mod params* parameter makes the parameter modulation navigation visible (again, useful for controlling the ui via midi). -->

### page 4: sequencer

selecting the third page (*sqncr*) using norns encoder e1 brings up the sequencer view. this page is only available if a grid with 16 or more columns is attached to the norns.

by default, the sequencer has 9 steps. each sequence step has 5 sub-steps by default. values are assigned to the sequencer's sub-steps. each time the sequencer completes a cycle, the values assigned to the next sub-step are activated. 

*EXAMPLE*

if step 1 of the sequencer has a sample rate of 1 assigned to sub-step 1 and a sample rate of 2 assigned to sub-step 2: 

  * the first time the sequencer arrives at step 1 the sample rate will be set 1
  * after the sequencer has gone through all the active steps (9 steps by default) and returns to step 1, the 2nd sub-step will be activated and the sample rate will be set to 2

the sequencer is built around the [Lattice](http://norns.local/doc/modules/Lattice.html) and [Sequins](https://monome.org/docs/norns/reference/lib/sequins) libraries.

* (G-L) number selection ui groups: 
  * (G) *integer place value* selectors: one or more integer place number selections (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.) may be applied to a sequencer value. integer place values are defined going from right to left from the *decimal point* button (*I*)
  * (H) *decimal point* indicator: this grid button separates *integer place value* selectors from *decimal place value* selectors. 
  * (I) *decimal place value* selectors: one or more decimal place number selections (tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.) may be assigned to a sequencer value. decimal place values are defined going from left to right from the *decimal point* button (*I*)
  * (J) *place value* selector: sets the place value. This value will be added to the other selected place values.
    * examples:
      * if the *decimal place value* is set to tenths and the first *place value* selector is selected, the place value will be set to 0.1. 
      * if the *integer place value* is set to ones and the third *place value* selector is selected, the place value will be set to 3.
  * (K) *number sequence mode* selector: 
    * the *number sequence mode* selector is set to *absolute* for each value by default (meaning, the value selected will be the value used, irrespective of the prior value).
    * if a number is set to a sequence mode of *relative*, its value is added to the previous value. 
  * (L) *polarity* selector: sets the value to positive or negative. the *polarity* selector is set to positive by default. the polarity selector only appear's does not appear for some numerical values
  * notes about number selection: 
    * number selection occurs by first selecting a place value (ui groups *G* and/or *H*) and then selecting a number (ui group *J*).   
    * if mulitple place values are set, they are added together. For example, if the *ones integer place value* is set to `5` and the *tenths integer place value* is set to `4`  
    * if a *decimal place* value or *integer place* value is set with a short press with nothing selected in the number row (*J*), the value is set to `0` at that place
    * if a *decimal place* value or *integer place* value is set with a long press and nothing selected in the number row (*J*), the value for the selected output/mode/param is set to nil and will be skipped
    * if a place value is set with a long press with a number selected in the number row (*J*), only the selected place value is used and other place values are cleared. 
* (K-L) note selection ui groups: 
  * (K) *note sequence mode* selector: 
    * there are two possible note sequence mode values: *absolute* and *relative* 
    * if the *number sequence mode* selector is set to *absolute*, the value selected will be the value used in the sequence, irrespective of the prior value.
    * if a note is set to a sequence mode of *relative*, its value is added to the previous value. 
    * the *number sequence mode* selector is set to *absolute* by default
  * (L) *octave* selector: shifts the note up/down octaves. the *octave* selector is set to 0 by default.
* (J) option/note/place value selection: depending on the configuration of the selected option/mode/param, this ui group is used to ether select from a list of options a place value or a note value. 
* (M) *sub-sequence* value selector: 
  * sets the value at each step of a five step sub-sequence based on the selections made UI groups G-L. 
  * sub-sequence values are set in sequential order, switching to a new set of sub-sequence values each time the main sequence completes its steps (9 by default).

##### grid navigation with norns ui
some navigation of the grid is also possible via the norns ui:

  * e2: highlight sequence set
  * e3: highlight next control set
  * k2: select previous control set
  * k3:
    * if a sequence set has been highlighted with e2, k3 selects the highlighted sequence set
    * otherwise, k3 select the next control set


##### clearing sequence data
* what data can be cleared:
  * all values set within a sequence set (row 1-5, column 1) 
  * all values set within a single a sequence step (rows 6-14, column 1)
  * all values set within a sub-sequence step (rows 6-10, row 8)
* to clear sequence data:
  * select the data element (sequence set, sequence step or sub-sequence step) you want to clear to activate it 
  * long press the key selected in the previous step and then release it

##### copy/paste sequence data
copy paste is available in a number of areas:

* sequence set: copy all the sequence/output settings from one sequence set to another
  * method #1:
    * press the key representing the source sequence set you want to copy from to active it
    * long press the key representing the target sequence set you want to copy to and release the key
  * method #2:
    * press the grid key representing the target sequence set (the sequence set you want to copy to) so it is activated (blinking). for example, to copy to the first sequence set, press grid key 1,1
    * again, press the grid key representing the target sequence set, this time holding the key down
    * with the target sequence set key pressed, also press the key representing the source sequence set you want to copy from
    * release the target sequence set key
* sequin: to copy from one sequin (sequence step) to another follow the directions for one of the two methods detailed above for sequence set copying



#### sequencer norns ui
page 3 of the norns ui shows the sequencer's state.

    * The breadcrumb in the screenshot above (*sqncr 5-1 sc voice 1*) indicates the following has been selected on the grid: 
      * sequence set: 5 
      * sequence step: 6 
      * output type: softcut
      * output: voice 1
      * mod: rate
      * selected value: 5 (relative)
  * (B) *active ui group*: displays the currently selected ui group
    * The screenshot above shows the *output values* ui group has been selected
  * (C) *sequence step*: three rows of values are displayed on the right representing the current output value at each step of the sequence (going left to right, top to bottom). 
  * (D) *sub-sequence value*: at each step of a sequence, there is a five step sub-sequence implemented as sequins nested within sequins. 
  * (E) *selected output value*: represents the value currently selected. when a sub-sequence step is selected on the grid (columns 6-10, row 8), this selected output value is assigned to the selected sub-sequence step.
  

## filterbank

parameters for the 16 channel bandpass filterbank may be controlled via the params menu or using the grid.

there are three parameters for each of the filterbanks' 16 channels: 
* level (amp)
* reciprocal quality (rq)
* center frequency (cf)

### filterbank grid controls
<img src="images/filter_grid.png" width="100%">

LEGEND

*mode selectors*
(1) *filter mode* selector (row 8, col 15): switches the grid to the bandpass filter control mode.
(2) *sequencer mode* selector (row 8, col 16): switches the grid to the sequencer control mode. (note: using encoder e1 to select the norns sequencer view (page 3) will automatically switch the grid to the sequencer mode.)

*filterbank view selectors*
(3) *level view selector*
(4) *reciprocal quality (rq) view selector*: 
(5) *center frequency (cf) view selector*

(A) *parameter value selectors*
the top 7 buttons in each row of the grid are used to set the value of the parameters of the filterbank's 16 bandpass filters. if none of the top 7 buttons are lit in a grid column, the selected parameter (level, rq, or cf) of the bandpass filter at the selected slot is at its lowest value. if all 7 buttons lit in a column, the active parameter filter at the selected slot is at its highest value.

*animation controls*
(6) *horizontal animation*: pressing this button (column 5, row 8) sweeps the values of each channel to the left cycling the values around to the far right channel after the values pass by the far left channel. if lit, pressing the button again turns off the animation.
(7) *vertical animation*: pressing this button (column 6, row 8) sweeps the values of each channel to the upwards, cycling back to the channel's min value when the max value is reached. if lit, pressing the button again turns off the animation.

*parameter overlay*
(8) selecting button (column 8, row 8) overlays the values of all three filter parameters over one another, making it easier to see how they interact, especially with animation turned on.

## misc parameters
the controls covered in the section below are found in the PARAMETERS>EDIT menu. with a few exceptions, these are not controllable with the grid sequencer.

### data management 
the current state of screens 1 & 2 and the grid sequencer may be saved, loaded, and deleted from the *data management* sub-menu.


### record player
records the loaded audio sample. how the sample gets recorded depends on the `play mode` setting:
* *stop*: record the entire sample 
* *loop all*: record the entire sample 
* *all cuts*: record all sample areas set by cutters
* *sel cut*: record the sample area set by the selected cutter

*important note*: if *play mode* is set to `all cuts`, all *rate* settings must either be positive or negative. 

### scales, notes, and tempo
set scale mode, root note, meter, and divisions

### audio routing
unlike most other norn's scripts, the *splnkr* script changes how audio is internally routed. this was done so that softcut audio can be processed by SuperCollider which isn't the case with the default routing configuration. three routing options are provided in the params menu:
* *in+cut->eng*: sends audio in and softcut audio to the supercollider engine 
* *in->eng*: sends audio in to the supercollider engine 
* *cut->eng*: sends softcut audio to the supercollider engine 

when the *splnkr* script is unloaded (e.g. when loading a different script or restarting norns), the script will reset the routing to the norns default settings.

### amp/freq detection
the *splnkr* script's SuperCollider engine includes frequency and amplitude detection which can be set in the params menu to trigger midi notes and crow notes/envelopes/gates/triggers. a number of options are provided to filter the frequency and amplitude (level) ranges sent to midi and crow. the notes sent to midi and crow can also be quantized to the values set in in SCALES, NOTES, AND TEMPO section of the params menu.

interesting feedback occurs when the source of audio that is routed to the SuperCollider engine from the norns audio in jacks (see *audio routing* above), is also being controlled with the *splnkr* script's amp/freq detection capabilities.

### inputs/outputs 
settings for midi, crow, jf, and w/ are avaiable in the params menu.

## credit and appreciation
* first and foremost, i'd like to thank [SPIKE the Percussionist](http://manipulate.net/) for the tremendous amount of testing, feedback, and encouragement he provided as i endeavored to get splnkr ready to publish
